# Description
This is a repository acting as a table of content for all my hackathons. It contains some basics stats as well as where the hackathons are from. It's also a way for me to keep track of how many hackathons I've been to, and which one is still unfinished for potential touch-up in the future.

# Summary
Number of Hackathons: 10

Explanation on status:
- Completed - the project is full fledged and functional. No future plans for improvement
- Incomplete - the project is not functional by the end of the hackathon. This is usually due to connectivity issues between front-end/back-end (e.g., CORS).
  - There might be plans to finish them in the future.
  - None of the projects were abandoned midway!! Still 100% effort and 0 sleep. Sometimes life is hard or project is too ambitious.
