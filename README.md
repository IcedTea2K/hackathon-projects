# Description
This is a repository acting as a table of content for all my hackathons. It contains some basics stats as well as where the hackathons are from. It's also a way for me to keep track of how many hackathons I've been to, and which one is still unfinished for potential touch-up in the future.

# Summary
Number of Hackathons: 10
